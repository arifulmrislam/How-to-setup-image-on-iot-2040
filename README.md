Important note:

	1.If we update the new version of node-red on IoT-2040. It will be take new path which we have to find out by "WinSCP" application.
Like our node-red path is this 
    "node /usr/lib/node/node-red/red" 
but after update a new version it will be like this 
    "node /usr/lib/node_modules/node-red/red".
SO, we have to sure that where we install our new version.
